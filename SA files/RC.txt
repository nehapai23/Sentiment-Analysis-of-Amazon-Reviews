( mayb it loves doing so, coz it did so again for 3 times ). back at home, put it on charge ( should i say turbo charge ? whatever ). after being fully charged, when unplugged, the touch went haywire. random selection, as if it had a mind of it's own. had to press power button for 2 mins to shut it down ( kill it's excitement ). another shocker was the heating issue. i was convinced that prolonged use of any device would heat it up. but this little deal breaker ( worth 15 grand ) was exception. it would heat if i would multitask. say if on call, a low end game would suffice it to heat above 45 c. another peculiar thing was as if using camera for about 2 mins or more, it would just piss it off n it would make u handle it, like having a morning toast. requested a refund. luckily it was within 10 day replacement / refund policy.read more › 55 comments 2,739 people found this helpful. was this review helpful to you?
