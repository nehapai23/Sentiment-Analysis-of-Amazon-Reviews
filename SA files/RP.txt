gbcolour  black verified purchase given the exceptional device and service provided by amazon  amiable electronics pvt ltd and motorola  i am obliged to write this review  for all those  seeking genuine review  u can trust me  had   devices in hand  compelling me to write this review  have to say  was quite impressed with the delivery    not quite  given they had my    grand    but still  satisfied with the device and considered myself lucky to have a brand new moto g  plus   had read reviews about getting used devices    was working as expected and left me contented  after a couple of days  the steady stream of issues initiated  i went through much   would rather say all   of the issues that were mentioned in reviews  initially it went blank while on call  no response  couldn t tell if the device was powered on  nothing made the backlight come to life  after a minute or so  rebooted itself    mayb it loves doing so  coz it did so again for   times    back at home  put it on charge   should i say turbo charge   whatever    after being fully charged  when unplugged  the touch went haywire  random selection  as if it had a mind of it s own  had to press power button for   mins to shut it down   kill it s excitement    another shocker was the heating issue  i was convinced that prolonged use of any device would heat it up  but this little deal breaker   worth    grand   was exception  it would heat if i would multitask  say if on call  a low end game would suffice it to heat above    c  another peculiar thing was as if using camera for about   mins or more  it would just piss it off n it would make u handle it  like having a morning toast  requested a refund  luckily it was within    day replacement   refund policy read more      comments       people found this

about amazon s customer service for moto products and the policies regarding refund and replacement  by soumik d  on    september      size     gbcolour  black verified purchase i have two moto phones that have problems and was denied replacement and refund  the agent i spoke to tried to help but amazon s moto process is so horrible she could not do anything but she did transfer me to the moto team after i repeatedly told her that the moto team is rude and do not help  i told her many times not to transfer to the moto team i dare you guys to keep your cool with these rude moto buggers in case you need to talk to them regarding replacement and refund issues   but she did it anyways  i wanted to talk to the supervisor but they will not take your call if it is a moto issue and you will inevitably be transferred to this rotten moto team  even after asking for the supervisor more than    times the person refused to take the call and the agent transferred me to the team that  handles  moto issues  abhishek rai from moto team the moto team guy was extremely rude  he did not let me speak  he actually threatened to disconnect the call if i did not stop talking and let him talk made me wonder whether he was the customer or i   he was trying to put words into my mouth and clearly said they do not have the policies no real replacement or refund window  mentioned on the phone s product page and if they do not think there is anything wrong with the phone  they will not replace or refund it  does not matter what the issue is  they are not replacing if they don t get pesky little error codes on their application  which they will make you install on your device to run certain tests  i am writing this review after buying two moto g  plus from amazon  do not buy this phone from amazon  the ten days replacement window is a scam read more       comments       people found this helpful  was this review helpful to you  yes no sending feedback    thank you for your feedback  sorry  we

been using this phone for the past   months and i must say  it is amazing  now  first things first  if anyone is interested in buying the phone  please don t let the product rating at amazon misguide you  i went through most of the reviews and found one issue in common  heating problem  well  the phone supports turbo charge for christ sake  it s supposed to get hot people  duh  let me divide the review into pros and cons  pros     battery life  my phone is using wifi     of the times and i m a big media consumer  youtube  music  movies  etc    still once fully charged it is good to go for a day with around     battery remaining     camera  man  the camera on this phone is a beast  both indoor and outdoor performance are at par with other handsets in the price range and also better than many phones that cost a lot more than it  the front camera is pretty good and supports flash  too  the professional mode is my fav feature  though     quick charging  it takes roughly around   hour    minutes for the phone to charge completely  quick charging is supported till     and is very very fast     ram management  it is pretty decent and ensures that you don t face any lag whatsoever     sound  i won t say the speakers are the best that i ve come across  but considering the price range they are pretty decent and gets the job done     call quality  the phone uses the speaker as the earpiece and thereby the call quality is crystal clear on this device  one of the best that i ve come across till date     stock android experience  the android experience on the device is phenomenal with no bloatware whatsoever  also  moto has promised an upgrade to android n and o for the device read more      comments       people found this helpful  was this review helpful to you  yes no
